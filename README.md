# esycpy

## ***WORK IN PROGRESS***

## Why?

I needed a utility to create hard-links of files rathen than copying those.
Hence this work.

Initially done the same in Powershell script, which was also at functional stage more or less.
This still require much work and possibly restructuring.

Will update this space then.
